# pkg with colors :D

The patches in this modified port of `pkg` will add colors to your `pkg`! <br>
Why did I make this? Because package managers without colors are boring. <br>
You'd build this like the normal port, using `make`.

If you encounter any bugs or missing bits (such as uncolored commands), open an issue!
